 * $ - your SkinnyMicro routes run in a subcontext of your web application.
 * $ - you want SkinnyMicro to have complete control of unmatched requests.
 * $ - you think you want a filter just for serving static content with the
 *     default servlet; SkinnyMicroServlet can do this too
 * $ - you don't know the difference
